```bash
npm install
node .
# Screenshots will appear in `shots` folder
```

Make sure to visually inspect screenshots as some don't generate correctly
(e.g. Rockfield), which I think might have something to do with parallax
effects on cover images.

Screenshots that need to be manually generated:
- Exford (just desktop)
- Rockfield (desktop + phone)
